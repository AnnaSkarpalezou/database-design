# Setup

---

## Installation
- Follow [these instructions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm) to install on your local machine.
- Or use `sqlite3` on the CS department's `i6` web server.

---

name: start

## Start
Run from the command shell. 

Replace `database_name` with a database name of your choosing:
```bash
sqlite3 database_name.db
```

If all goes swell, you are now in the SQLite command prompt.  

And if a database with this name didn't previously exist, it has now been created.

---

name: quit

## Quit
To quit SQLite, use the `.quit` helper function:
```sqlite3
.quit
```

Now go and [re-start](#start) again!

---

name: create-table

## Create table
We need a table in SQLite that will accommodate data on [school districts from the 2010 US census](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.2010.html), including each district's...
- name
- state
- lowest grade taught
- highest grade taught
- population
- number of households
- land area
- water area
- geocoordinates (latitude & longitude)

---

## Create table
Create a table to accommodate the US Census school district data:

```sqlite3
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sd;
CREATE TABLE sd (
  sd_state text,
  sd_geoid text,
  sd_name text,
  sd_lowestGrade text,
  sd_highestGrade text,
  sd_pop_2010 integer,
  sd_hu_2010 integer,
  sd_aland real,
  sd_awater real,
  sd_aland_sqmi real,
  sd_awater_sqmi real,
  sd_intptlat real,
  sd_intptlong real,
  PRIMARY KEY(sd_geoid)
);
```

The primary key, the unique identifier of each record, is set to be the `sd_geoid` field.

---

## View table schema
Viewing the `schema` of the `sd` table shows the command used to create it:
```sqlite
.schema sd
```

---

name: import-data

## Import data
Import from a [comma-separated values (CSV) file](../files/sqlite/sd.csv) of US census data on school districts into an SQLite table named `sd`... replace the path to the .csv file with one that works with your file system:
```sqlite
.mode csv
.import /Users/foobar/some_directory/sd.csv sd
```

---

## Drop table
Delete the `sd` table:
```sqlite
drop table sd
```

Now go [create it](#create-table) and [import data into it](#import-data) again!

---

## Use a script
Saving the commands to create and import data into [an SQL script](../files/sd_setup_script.sql) can save time and effort.  Change the file path to whatever path works on your system:
```sqlite
.read /Users/foobar/some_directory/sd_setup_script.sql
```

# Simple reads

---

## All school districts
Show all fields of all records.... there are a lot.
```sqlite3
select * from sd;
```

---

## School districts in New York State
The `where` clause filters results to only those within New York.... there are a lot.
```sqlite3
select * from sd where sd_state = "NY";
```

---

## Show only school district names
Each records contains many fields.  Limit to just the `name` of each school district:
```sqlite3
select sd_name from sd where sd_state = "NY";
```

Multiple fields can be selected by supplying a comma-separated list, such as `sd_name, sd_state`.

---

## Sort the results
Sort the records by school district name in reverse alphabetic order:
```sqlite3
select sd_name from sd where sd_state = "NY" order by sd_name desc;
```

`asc` can be used to indicate ascending order.

---

## Limit the results
Show only the first 5 in the reverse-alphabetic list of New York school districts:
```sqlite3
select sd_name from sd where sd_state = "NY" order by sd_name desc limit 5;
```

---

## Offset the results
Show the second and third `pages` with 5 results each:
```sqlite3
select sd_name from sd where sd_state = "NY" order by sd_name desc limit 5 offset 5;
```

```sqlite3
select sd_name from sd where sd_state = "NY" order by sd_name desc limit 5 offset 10;
```

---

## Smallest school districts
The 10 smallest school districts in the country:
```sqlite3
select sd_name, sd_state, sd_pop_2010 from sd order by sd_pop_2010 desc limit 10;
```

# Functions

---

## Concept
There are a variety of [built-in aggregate functions](https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html) available to be used in queries. These are used to calculate aggregate statistics from the records returned by any query.

---

## Counting records
Calculate how many school districts exist in the US and Puerto Rico using the `count()` function.
```sqlite3
select count(sd_geoid) from sd;
```

The primary key field, `sd_geoid` is guaranteed to be unique for each record, while other fields may not be.

---

## Counting records in a filtered result set
Count the number of school districts in New York State by filtering results with a `where` clause.
```sqlite3
select count(sd_geoid) from sd where sd_state = "NY";
```

---

## Calculating average
Calculate the average population of school districts across the US, using the `avg()` function.
```sqlite3
select avg(sd_pop_2010) from sd;
```

This will return a floating point number. There are no half people, so we could round the result using the `round()` function, as in `round( avg(sd_pop_2010) )`.

---

## Calculating sum
Calculate the total population in the country, using the `sum()` function.
```sqlite3
select sum(sd_pop_2010) from sd;
```

---

name: grouping
class: center, middle

# Grouping

---

## Concept
Grouping records together by some attributes they share in common allows us to calculate aggregate statistics.

---

## Counting school districts per state
Counting the number of school districts per state requires us to group together all school districts in each state:
```sqlite3
select count(sd_geoid) from sd group by sd_state;
```

---

## Counting school districts per state... better
The previous query showed us the numbers, but not which state they represented.

View the state name *and* the number of school districts in each state:
```sqlite3
select sd_state, count(sd_geoid) from sd group by sd_state;
```

---

## Counting school districts per state in of descending quantity
The state name and the number of school districts in each state, in descending order:
```sqlite3
select sd_state, count(sd_geoid) from sd group by sd_state order by count(sd_geoid) desc;
```

Note that the clause, `order by count(sd_geoid)` treats the count as if it were like any other field to sort by.  We can make this easier to write by using an alias:
```sqlite3
select sd_state, count(sd_geoid) as num_districts from sd group by sd_state order by num_districts desc;
```

---

## Calculating the 3 most populated states
Sort states by aggregate population in descending order, then limit to the first 3 records.
```sqlite3
select sd_state, sum(sd_pop_2010) as pop from sd group by sd_state order by pop desc limit 3;
```

---

## Calculating the 3 least populated states
Sort states by aggregate population in ascending order, then limit to the first 3 records.
```sqlite3
select sd_state, sum(sd_pop_2010) as pop from sd group by sd_state order by pop asc limit 3;
```

# Combinations

---

## Concept
Let's take what we've learned a step further.

---

## All of New England
New England is made of several states.  Let's find the top ten largest school districts in this combined region using an `in` clause:
```sqlite3
select sd_name, sd_state, sd_pop_2010 from sd where sd_state in ("ME", "VT", "NH", "MA", "RI") ORDER BY sd_pop_2010 desc limit 10;
```

---

## Highest population density school districts
Which school districts have the highest population density?
```sqlite3
select sd_name, sd_state, round(sd_pop_2010 / sd_aland_sqmi) as density from sd order by density desc limit 10;
```

---

## Lowest population density school districts
Which school districts have the lowest population density?
```sqlite3
select sd_name, sd_state, round(sd_pop_2010 / sd_aland_sqmi) as density from sd order by density asc limit 10;
```

This query will return a bunch of school districts with the name including the text, "School District Not Defined"... let's exclude these:
```sqlite3
select sd_name, sd_state, round(sd_pop_2010 / sd_aland_sqmi) as density from sd where sd_name not like "%not defined%" order by density asc limit 10;
```

---

## Highest population density states
Which states have the highest population density?
```sqlite3
select sd_state, round( sum(sd_pop_2010) / sum(sd_aland_sqmi) ) as density from sd group by sd_state order by density desc limit 10;
```

---

## Lowest population density states
Which states have the lowest population density?
```sqlite3
select sd_state, round( sum(sd_pop_2010) / sum(sd_aland_sqmi) ) as density from sd group by sd_state order by density asc limit 10;
```
