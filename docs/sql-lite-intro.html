# Overview

---

name: installation

## Installation
- Follow [these instructions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm) to install on your local machine.
- Or use `sqlite3` on the CS department's `i6` web server.

---

name: start

## Start
Run from the command shell... replace `database_name` with a database name of your choosing:
```bash
sqlite3 database_name.db
```

If all goes swell, you are now in the SQLite command prompt.  And if a database with this name doesn't already exist, it will be created.

---

name: quit

## Quit
To quit, use the `.quit` helper function:
```sqlite
sqlite> .quit
```

Now go and [re-start](#start) again!

---

name: import

## Import data
Import from a comma-separated values (CSV) file into an SQLite table named `sd`... replace the path to the .csv file with one that works with your file system:
```sqlite
sqlite> .mode csv
sqlite> .import /Users/foobar/Desktop/deena/sd.csv sd
```

---

## View table schema
View the `schema` of the `sd` table that was created by the `.import` command:
```sqlite
sqlite> .schema sd
```
