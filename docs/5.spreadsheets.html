# Overview

---

template: overview

## Intro
Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, Google Sheets, and their spreadsheet software ilk organize data sets into *rows* and *columns*. 

--

![Spreadsheet with rows and columns](../files/data_formats/spreadsheet_structure.png)

--

- Each row and column has a *unique identifier* - rows numbers and column letters.  
--
These indices are attached to the spreadsheet, not the data.

--

- At the intersection of each row and column is a *data cell*, where data of a variety of types can either be *manually input* or *formulaically calculated*.

---

template: overview

## Programming environment
Behind the scenes in any spreadsheet software is a sophisticated *programming environment* which can be accessed most simply by calling *built-in functions* from the text within a data cell. 

--

![Spreadsheet formula](../files/data_formats/spreadsheet_formula.png)

template: overview

## Programming environment
Users who are familiar with high-level computer programming concepts can write *custom functions* using a spreadsheet software's *Integrated Development Environment* (IDE).

![Spreadsheet integrated development environment](../files/data_formats/spreadsheet_ide.png)

---

template: overview

## Programming environment
The following spreadsheet softwares have integrated IDEs:

--

- **Microsoft Excel** has the Visual Basic for Applications Editor (VBA editor) .
    - Access from the `Developer` menu.  
    - Programs are written in the Visual Basic programming language.

--

- **Google Sheets** has the Script Editor.
    - Access from the `Tools`->`Script Editor` menu.
    - Programs are written in Javascript.

--

- **Apple Numbers** integrates with Apple's automation language, AppleScript.
    - Access via Apple's Script Editor app.
    - Programs are written in AppleScript.

--

- **LibreOffice Calc** provides several scripting options.
    - Access in the `Tools`->`Customize` menu.
    - Program can written in Javascript, Python, LibreOffice Basic, and BeanShell.

## Spreadsheets as databases

Spreadsheet software can be considered a type of database and, in fact, have much in common with more sophisticated *relational databases*.


--

- each sheet holds data about a single *entity* - a kind of thing

--

- sheets hold *records* - data about one instance of the entity (i.e. one of the things)

--

- each record has the same fixed set of *fields* (i.e. there is a fixed schema)


--

- each *field* represents one attribute of the record

--

- sheets are shown as *tables*, records are stored in *rows*, fields are in *columns*

--

- automated *functions* allow you to filter the data and perform analysis

---

template: overview

## Data munging
Using a spreadsheet does not absolve one of doing data munging.  
--
Some data munging tasks common to spreadsheets:

--

- Excessive **empty rows and columns** should be removed

--

- Make sure there are **easy-to-understand headings** to each column

--

- **Break up any fields that contain more than one piece of data** into multiple fields so each can be analyzed independently

--

- **Indicate data types** appropriate for each column to harness the programming power of spreadsheets

---

# Typical Example

--

## Raw data
We will look into data on the number of COVID-19 cases *aggregated*, updated daily, and *published* by the New York Times in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format.

--

![Raw CSV data](../files/data_formats/csv_raw_data.png)

--

- Access the raw data in CSV form [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv); more about this data set [here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

--

- In case you were wondering, the `fips` column holds unique identifiers for each county, according to the [FIPS system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_county_code).

---

template: example

## Import into spreadsheet
This particular data set contains *a million or more records* (thousands of new records are added each day).  Upon importing the raw data file into a spreadsheet, we immediately hit a problem with spreadsheet software...

--

- With large data sets, spreadsheets often work slowly and sometimes don't work at all.

--

- Web-based (i.e. 'cloud'-based) spreadsheet programs, such as Google Sheets, have the hardest time processing large data sets and may crash.

--

- Native desktop applications, such as Microsoft Excel and Apple Numbers work significantly better with large data sets.

--

- If you must use a web-based spreadsheet for a large data set, use a plain text editor to first chop up the CSV file into a bunch of smaller CSV files and then import each smaller file into its own sheet (*not recommended*).

---

template: example

## A sheet for an entity

Once imported into a spreadsheet, the data appears in a typical nicely-aligned *row/column structure*.

![Spreadsheet with rows and columns](../files/data_formats/spreadsheet_structure.png)

--

- Each *row* is a *record* with *fields* in the *columns* describing various attributes of *one particular instance of the entity*.

--

- In this example, each row represents *COVID-19 stats for one day in one US county* during the pandemic.

---

template: example

## Sorting rows
If we simply wanted to sort the rows by the number of cases or the number of deaths, we can do that with the click of a button.

--

- Highlight the entire data set (not including the headings), and the sort menu item (the exact position of this button varies by spreadsheet program).

![Sorting data in a spreadsheet](../files/data_formats/spreadsheet_sort.png)

---

template: example

## Simple statistics

Spreadsheets are great for simple statistical analysis, such as finding the *sum*, *average*, *minimum*, *maximum*, *standard deviation*, of a series of values.

--

- To do this, we will run formulas using the spreadsheet's *built-in functions*.

--

- To enter a formula into a cell, click into the cell and type the equals sign `=` followed by the formula.

--

-  To calculate total deaths, enter `=SUM( F1 : F1030786 )` into column `F` of a new row at the very end of the spreadsheet, where `F1` is the first cell in the deaths column, and `F1030786` is the last value in that column - your last row number will differ.  Hit the `enter/return` key when done.

---

template: example

## Passing the smell test
Always use your common sense to think about whether the raw data and your analysis of that data make sense... the so-called *smell test*.

--

- Summing the values in the deaths column leads to a result of about *65 million deaths from COVID-19 in the US* at the time of this writing.

--

- [Authoritative reports](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) put that number at about *486,000 deaths* at the time of this writing.

--

- Something does not smell good!  

--

- Either the raw data is flawed, or we are wrong in our analysis.

--

- What went wrong?!


---

template: example

## The meaning of the data
Upon further inspection, it seem that each row in the data set represents the *cumulative data for that county*.

--

- So we have misunderstood the meaning of the data 
--
- *a very very common problem*!

--

- Since each record includes a cumulative count of the deaths, in order to calculate total US deaths, we simply have to *sum the death counts for all counties on the most recent day available in the data set*: `=SUM( F1027540 : F1030786 )` (your row row numbers may differ if viewing more recent data)

--

- This results in a *total US death count of 485,154* (as of January 15th 2021)... a better-smelling number.

--

- PS: this data set has already been munged well for us by The New York Times.... not all data sets will be so good!

---

name: assumptions

## Assumptions
In doing such a simple calculation, we have made a series of assumptions that we should be aware of, in case they prove to be false.

--

- We have assumed that the raw data is reliable and trustworthy

--

- We have assumed that no deaths are counted simultaneously in two or more different US counties 

--

- We have assumed that the data set includes one record for every US county on each day

--

- How can we check these assumptions?

# Imposing Criteria

--

## Analyzing a subset of records
What if we wanted to count only *total COVID-19 cases in New York's Hudson Valley region*, which is composed of 11 of New York State's 62 counties..

--

- Basic statistical functions, such as `SUM()`, `AVERAGE()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `STDEV()` work as we have seen when calculating total deaths.  But they cannot filter the records for us.

--

- Remember, the counts are cumulative. So let's copy just the records for the most recent date and *put them into their own sheet*.  This will speed up the program massively and is now small enough to be shared in a web-based spreadsheet - see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ddVWvL9O4uFPir5XGVP21n0_jhZItq--Fu7psPE4mrM/edit?usp=sharing).

--

- We could manually go through and add up the case counts for the 11 counties of interest, but that would be very time consuming.

--

- Rather, we should use the *spreadsheet's filtering abilities* to extract data from the rows representing the counties of interest to us, and then run our statistics functions on just those filtered results.

---

template: criteria

## Filtering records
To calculate *total COVID-19 case counts in New York's Hudson Valley region*, we will go step-by-step, rather than try to do everything at once.

--

- First create two new columns: one for county names and the other for case counts.

![Extraction column](../files/data_formats/spreadsheet_extraction_column.png)

---

template: criteria

## Filtering records (continued)
Now add a formula into the `Case count` field corresponding to the first county: `=SUMIF( B:B, H2, E:E )`.  Note the use of `SUMIF` to add criteria.

--

- `SUMIF` will sum together case counts (column `E`) for any records where the county (column `B`) matches the county name of interest (cell `H2`).

--

- Copy this formula into the `Case counts` field for each county.  Be sure to update `H2` to be the correct cell identifier for each county.

--

- You can use the spreadsheet's *autofill* feature to do this copying for you.

--

![Extraction complete](../files/data_formats/spreadsheet_extraction_column_complete.png)

---

template: criteria

## Filtering records (continued again)
We now have total case counts for each county of interest.  If we add them all up, we will have *total case counts for the entire Hudson Valley*.

--

- In our custom `Case counts` column, in a row below the last county of interest, enter a function to calculate the `SUM` of all case counts.  A bit more than `600,000` as of January 9.

![Extraction summation](../files/data_formats/spreadsheet_extraction_column_total.png)

---

template: criteria

## Mashing up data sets
We know how many COVID-19 cases there have been in the Hudson Valley... but what percent of the population does this represent?

--

- Finding a reputable population estimate for each county is not difficult... ([for example](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html#par_textimage_739801612)).  `Cases as % of population` is only a simple formula away.

## Results
The completed spreadsheet is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f4Qm0OIbeynTZbXUujslEX5L3FXJ5bi2GOXguJFMLQw/edit?usp=sharing).

Our data and initial analysis suggest that *more than 25% of the population in New York's Hudson Valley have had COVID-19*... that's 1 in every 5 people.

--

- Does this smell good?
    - Look over the numbers and do a sanity check.  
    - Compare your results to other reputable sources of information and analysis.

--

- Where might we have gone wrong?

--

- What other assumptions might this result depend upon that we did not [originally consider](#assumptions).

---

template: criteria

## Results
We have made a mistake  
--
of course.

--

- Our data contains COVID-19 cases for counties in all US states.

--

- Our use of the `SUMIF` functions add case counts for only those counties with particular names.

--

- We didn't consider that perhaps there might be counties with the same names in different states.  
--
There are.

--

- We need to apply two criteria - add only those rows where the county names AND the state names match.

--

- Whereas the `SUMIF` function can only apply one criterion, the `SUMIFS` function can apply multiple criteria.  
--
Look up documentation and try it out.

## Further Exploration

--

### Time series
It might be interesting to see how COVID-19 case counts vary over time.

--

- The original New York Times data set has cumulative case numbers for all dates since the pandemic began.

--

- Similarly to how we counted cases within the Hudson Valley, we could calculate cases for each date using `SUMIF`, where we filter by only those rows that match a specific date.

--

- If we wanted to show case counts over time for only the Hudson Valley, we would use `SUMIFS` to apply three criteria: 

--

    - matching a specified date
--
    -  matching a specified county name
--
    -  matching the state of New York

--

- Besides total case counts over time, how would we calculate the change in case counts over time?

---

### Visualizations
Visualizations can help people infer insights that may not be obvious by staring at numbers.  

--

Spreadsheets are remarkably good at generating simple visualizations, such as:

--

- Line charts

--

- Area charts

--

- Column & bar charts

--

- Pie charts

--

- Scatter plots

--

- ... and more

---

template: further-exploration

### Pivot tables
Pivot tables are a very powerful feature of spreadsheets that allow us to group together records based on one or more shared field values, and then automatically perform aggregate statistics on each group.

--

For example, using a pivot table, we might easily group all counties in our data set by state, and then perform statistics on each state, potentially showing us:

--

- total case counts per state

--

- total deaths per state

--

- the miinimum and maximum case counts per state

--

See [an example of this data with a pivot table and a map chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PS15N7Ixyt9Se5sM47YNMe_VBPJ5MZvQk1LUX91xenU/edit?usp=sharing).
