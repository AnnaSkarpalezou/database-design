- manifest typing
- small footprint
- public domain source code
- industry-proven

---

name: setup

# Setup

--

## Installation
How to install and run SQLite:

- OS X comes with SQLite installed, although not necessarily the latest version.

- To install or upgrade, download the latest *Source code* [here](https://sqlite.org/download.html) - pick the *"amalgamation" with "configure" script*.  Unzip the file and follow the instructions in the file named `README.txt`.

---

template: setup
name: start

## Start
Run from the command shell. 

Replace `database_name` with a database name of your choosing:
```bash
sqlite3 database_name.db
```

- If all goes swell, you are now in the SQLite command prompt.  

- And if a database with this name didn't previously exist, it has now been created.

---

template: setup
name: quit

## Quit
To quit SQLite, use the `.quit` helper function:
```sqlite3
.quit
```

Now go and [re-start](#start) again!

---

name: crud

# CRUD

---

template: crud

## Overview
Data operations fall into one of four types:
- **C**reate - creating new data
- **R**ead - viewing existing data
- **U**pdate - updating existing data
- **D**elete - deleting existing data

These operations are affectionately known as data [CRUD](https://www.wordnik.com/words/crud).

---

template: crud

## Definition

"crud" definition from [wordnik.com](https://www.wordnik.com/words/crud):
> n.	A coating or an incrustation of filth or refuse.
>
> n.	Something loathsome, despicable, or worthless.

Welcome to the world of data!

---

template: crud

## Create (tables)

Before any data can be added to the database, a *table* must be created using the `create table` command, including

- the name of the table

- a list of fields

- the data type assigned to each field, e.g. `INTEGER`, `REAL` (floating point), `NUMERIC`, `TEXT`, or `BLOB` (no data type assigned), 

- an indication of which field is the *primary key*.

We will write these and other `CRUD` commands in the `SQL` language, which is common among relational databases.

---

template: crud

## Create (tables... continued)

An example of a table to hold student information:
```sqlite3
create table students (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name TEXT,
  last_name TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  city TEXT,
  state TEXT,
  country TEXT
);
```

- The `primary key` setting specifies which field holds the unique identifier of each row - in this case the `id` field.

---

template: crud

## Create rows manually

One can create new records in a table using the `insert` command
```sqlite3
insert into students (first_name, last_name, email, city, state, country) values ("Foo", "Barstein", "fb1258@nyu.edu", "Dallas", "Texas", "United States");
```
  - Notice that the `id` value is not specified - it will be automatically supplied by the database if we don't specify

---

template: crud

## Create rows by importing a data file
One can import records from a file into a table using the `.import` function

```sqlite3
.mode csv
.import /Users/foobar/some_directory/student_list.csv students
```

- SQLite natively imports *CSV* files... just make sure to turn on `csv` mode first to avoid potential problems.

- *JSON* files are not natively supported and will have to be *transformed* into a supported format prior to import.

- Download a [CSV file for this example](../files/sqlite/student_list.csv).  You will need to do a bit of *data munging* on the file - simply remove the first line with the headings.



---

template: crud

## Read

Read operations are performed with the `select` command

```sqlite3
select first_name from students where city="Grand Rapids";
```

- The command, `.mode csv` will make the output look like a CSV file.  `.mode list` will return to the default.  There are other useful modes.

- The command, `.separator ";"` will set the separator between fields to a semi-colon `;` - change it to whatever character you prefer.

- These two commands (`.mode` and `.separator`) can be useful for transforming the data into a format that is easily imported into another tools or programs.

---

template: crud

## Update

Update operations are performed with the `update` command

```sqlite3
update students set first_name="Baz" where id=15;
```

--

Updates to the overall schema of the table can be done with the `alter table` command
```sqlite3
alter table students add column photo blob;
```

---

template: crud

## Delete

Delete can be one of a few types:
- Delete a particular record using the `delete` command
```sqlite3
delete from students where first_name="Baz" and last_name="Trownson";
```

--

- Drop an entire table using the `drop table` command
```sqlite3
drop table students;
```

---

name: import-data

# Import data

---

template: import-data

## Find raw data
We will work with data on [school districts from the 2010 US census](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.2010.html) This includes each district's...
- name
- state
- lowest grade taught
- highest grade taught
- population
- number of households
- land area
- water area
- geocoordinates (latitude & longitude)
- ... and a unique identifier for each row to serve as the *primary key*

We need a table in SQLite that will accommodate this.

---

template: import-data
name: create-table

## Create table
Create a table to accommodate the US Census school district data:

```sqlite3
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sd;
CREATE TABLE sd (
  sd_state text,
  sd_geoid text PRIMARY KEY,
  sd_name text,
  sd_lowestGrade text,
  sd_highestGrade text,
  sd_pop_2010 integer,
  sd_hu_2010 integer,
  sd_aland real,
  sd_awater real,
  sd_aland_sqmi real,
  sd_awater_sqmi real,
  sd_intptlat real,
  sd_intptlong real
);
```

The *primary key*, the unique identifier of each record, is set to be the `sd_geoid` field.

---

template: import-data

## View list of tables
To view a list of any tables that exist in this database, use the `.tables` function.
```sqlite3
.tables
```

---

template: import-data

## View table schema
Viewing the `schema` of the `sd` table shows the command used to create it:
```sqlite3
.schema sd
```

---

template: import-data
name: import-data-really

## Import data
Import from a [comma-separated values (CSV) file](../files/sqlite/sd.csv) of US census data on school districts into an SQLite table named `sd`... replace the path to the .csv file with one that works with your file system:
```sqlite3
.mode csv
.import /Users/foobar/some_directory/sd.csv sd
```

---

template: import-data

## Drop table
Delete the `sd` table:
```sqlite3
drop table sd
```

Now go [create it](#create-table) and [import data into it](#import-data) again!

---

template: import-data

## Use a script
Saving the commands to create and import data into [an SQL script](../files/sqlite/sd_setup_script.sql) can save time and effort - you can re-create and re-import data at any time by simply executing the script.

Change the file path to whatever path works on your system:
```sqlite3
.read /Users/foobar/some_directory/sd_setup_script.sql
```

---

template: import-data

## Share a database
If you want to copy a database or share it with someone (or yourself), simply pass around a copy of [the database file](../files/sqlite/sd.db) with the data in it.

And then [quit](#quit) and [re-start](#start) SQLite using that database file.  No need to create tables from scratch or import anything.

Quit
```sqlite3
.quit
```

Restart
```bash
sqlite3 sd.db
```

Being a portable, small footprint, simple file format, cross-platform database system has its advantages.

---

template: import-data

## Dot functions
You have no-doubt noticed our use of some *dot functions*, such as:
- `.quit` - quit SQLite
- `.tables` - view a list of tables in the database
- `.schema [table name]` - show the schema of a table 
- `.mode [mode]` - change the way data is formatted on screen, e.g `csv`, `list`, `markdown`, and more
- `.import [CSV filepath] [table name]` - import a data file into a table
- `.read [SQL script filepath]` - run an SQL script file

Replace the terms in square brackets with the real values (and delete the square brackets).

# Simple reads

---

template: simple-reads

## All school districts
Show all fields of all records.... there are a lot.
```sqlite3
select * from sd;
```

---

template: simple-reads

## School districts in New York State
The `where` clause filters results to only those within New York.... there are a lot.
```sqlite3
select * from sd where sd_state = "NY";
```

---

template: simple-reads

## Show only school district names
Each records contains many fields.  Limit to just the `name` of each school district:
```sqlite3
select sd_name from sd where sd_state = "NY";
```

Multiple fields can be selected by supplying a comma-separated list, such as `sd_name, sd_state`.

---

template: simple-reads

## Sort the results
Sort the records by school district name in reverse alphabetic order:
```sqlite3
select sd_name from sd where sd_state = "NY" order by sd_name desc;
```

`asc` or `desc` can be used to indicate ascending or descending order.

---

template: simple-reads

## Limit the results
Show only the first 5 in the reverse-alphabetic list of New York school districts:
```sqlite3
select sd_name from sd where sd_state = "NY" order by sd_name desc limit 5;
```

---

template: simple-reads

## Offset the results
Show the second and third `pages` with 5 results each:
```sqlite3
select sd_name from sd where sd_state = "NY" order by sd_name desc limit 5 offset 5;
```

```sqlite3
select sd_name from sd where sd_state = "NY" order by sd_name desc limit 5 offset 10;
```

---

template: simple-reads

## Smallest school districts
The 10 smallest school districts in the country:
```sqlite3
select sd_name, sd_state, sd_pop_2010 from sd order by sd_pop_2010 asc limit 10;
```

# Functions

---

template: functions

## Concept
There are a variety of [built-in aggregate functions](https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html) available to be used in queries. These are used to calculate aggregate statistics from the records returned by any query.

- These are similar to the statistical functions built into spreadsheet software:, `SUM()`, `AVERAGE()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `COUNT()`, etc.
---

template: functions

## Counting records
Calculate how many school districts exist in the US and Puerto Rico using the `count()` function.
```sqlite3
select count(sd_geoid) from sd;
```

- The `COUNT()` function returns the number of values in the *field* indicated as an argument.

- The primary key field, `sd_geoid`, is guaranteed to be unique for each record, while other fields may not be.

---

template: functions

## Counting records in a filtered result set
Count the number of school districts in New York State by filtering results with a `where` clause.
```sqlite3
select count(sd_geoid) from sd where sd_state = "NY";
```

- We have thus applied a filter - the `COUNT()` function will only count those rows that match the criteria indicated in the `WHERE` clause.

---

template: functions

## Calculating average
Calculate the average population of school districts across the US, using the `avg()` function.
```sqlite3
select avg(sd_pop_2010) from sd;
```

- The `AVG()` function will return a floating point number. 

- In actuality, there are no half people or 1/4 people.  So we could round the result using the `round()` function, as in `round( avg(sd_pop_2010) )`.

---

template: functions

## Calculating sum
Calculate the total population in the country, using the `sum()` function.
```sqlite3
select sum(sd_pop_2010) from sd;
```

And, of course, we could calculate the total population of just Minnesota by filtering this query with a `WHERE` clause:
```sqlite3
select sum(sd_pop_2010) from sd where sd_state = "MN";
```

---

name: grouping

# Grouping

---

template: grouping

## Concept
Grouping records together by some attributes they share in common allows us to calculate aggregate statistics.

---

template: grouping

## Counting school districts per state
Counting the number of school districts per state requires us to group together all school districts in each state:
```sqlite3
select count(sd_geoid) from sd group by sd_state;
```

- Thus we don't count the number of unique geoids in the entire table.  This performs a separate count for each group.
---

template: grouping

## Counting school districts per state... better
The previous query showed us the numbers, but not which state they represented.

View the state name *and* the number of school districts in each state:
```sqlite3
select sd_state, count(sd_geoid) from sd group by sd_state;
```

---

template: grouping

## Counting school districts per state in descending order
The state name and the number of school districts in each state, in descending order:
```sqlite3
select sd_state, count(sd_geoid) from sd group by sd_state order by count(sd_geoid) desc;
```

Note that the clause, `order by count(sd_geoid)` treats the count as if it were like any other field to sort by.  We can make this less redundant to write by using an *alias* for the result of the count:
```sqlite3
select sd_state, count(sd_geoid) as num_districts from sd group by sd_state order by num_districts desc;
```

---

template: grouping

## Calculating the 3 most populous states
Sort states by aggregate population in descending order, then limit to the first 3 records.
```sqlite3
select sd_state, sum(sd_pop_2010) as pop from sd group by sd_state order by pop desc limit 3;
```

---

template: grouping

## Calculating the 3 least populous states
Sort states by aggregate population in ascending order, then limit to the first 3 records.
```sqlite3
select sd_state, sum(sd_pop_2010) as pop from sd group by sd_state order by pop asc limit 3;
```

# Combinations

---

template: combinations

## Concept
Let's take what we've learned a step further.

---

template: combinations

## All of New England
New England is made of several states.  Let's find the top ten largest school districts in this combined region using an `in` operator:
```sqlite3
select sd_name, sd_state, sd_pop_2010 from sd where sd_state in ("ME", "VT", "NH", "MA", "RI") ORDER BY sd_pop_2010 desc limit 10;
```

---

template: combinations

## Highest population density school districts
Which school districts have the highest population density?
```sqlite3
select sd_name, sd_state, round(sd_pop_2010 / sd_aland_sqmi) as density from sd order by density desc limit 10;
```

---

template: combinations

## Lowest population density school districts
Which school districts have the lowest population density?
```sqlite3
select sd_name, sd_state, round(sd_pop_2010 / sd_aland_sqmi) as density from sd order by density asc limit 10;
```

This query will return a bunch of school districts with the name including the text, "School District Not Defined"... let's exclude these:
```sqlite3
select sd_name, sd_state, round(sd_pop_2010 / sd_aland_sqmi) as density from sd where sd_name not like "%not defined%" order by density asc limit 10;
```

---

template: combinations

## Highest population density states
Which states have the highest population density?
```sqlite3
select sd_state, round( sum(sd_pop_2010) / sum(sd_aland_sqmi) ) as density from sd group by sd_state order by density desc limit 10;
```

---

template: combinations

## Lowest population density states
Which states have the lowest population density?
```sqlite3
select sd_state, round( sum(sd_pop_2010) / sum(sd_aland_sqmi) ) as density from sd group by sd_state order by density asc limit 10;
```
