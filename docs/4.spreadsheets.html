# Overview

template: overview

## Intro
Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, Google Sheets, and their spreadsheet software ilk organize data sets into *rows* and *columns*. 

--

![Spreadsheet with rows and columns](../files/data_formats/spreadsheet_structure.png)

--

- Each row and column has a *unique identifier* - rows are numbered and columns are lettered.

--

- At the intersection of each row and column is a *data cell*, where data of a variety of types can either be *manually input* or *formulaically calculated*.

---

template: overview

## Programming environment
Behind the scenes in any spreadsheet software is a sophisticated *programming environment* which can be accessed by simply calling *built-in functions* from the text within a data cell. 

--

## Programming environment
Users who are familiar with high-level computer programming concepts can write *custom functions* using the spreadsheet softwares' *Integrated Development Environments* (IDEs).

## Spreadsheets as databases

Spreadsheet software can be considered a type of database and, in fact, have much in common with more sophisticated *relational databases*.


--

- each sheet holds data about a single *entity* - a kind of thing

--

- sheets hold *records* - data about one instance of the entity (i.e. one of the things)

--

- each row has the same fixed set of *fields* (i.e. there is a fixed schema)


--

- each *fields* represents one attribute of the record the row describes

--

- sheets are shown as *tables*, records are stored in *rows*, fields are in *columns*

--

- automated *functions* allow you to filter the data and perform analysis

---

# Typical Example

--

## Raw data
We will look into data on the number of COVID-19 cases *aggregated*, updated daily, and *published* by the New York Times in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format.

--

![Raw CSV data](../files/data_formats/csv_raw_data.png)

--

- Access the raw data in CSV form [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv); more about this data set [here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

--

- In case you were wondering, the `fips` column holds unique identifiers for each county, according to the [FIPS system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_county_code).

---

template: example

## Import into spreadsheet
This particular data set contains *a million or more records* (thousands of new records are added each day).  Upon importing the raw data file into a spreadsheet, we immediately hit a problem with spreadsheet software...

--

- With large data sets, spreadsheets often work slowly and sometimes don't work at all.

--

- Web-based (i.e. 'cloud'-based) spreadsheet programs, such as Google Sheets, have the hardest time processing large data sets and may crash.

--

- Native desktop applications, such as Microsoft Excel and Apple Numbers work significantly better with large data sets.

--

- If you must use a web-based spreadsheet for a large data set, use a plain text editor to first chop up the CSV file into a bunch of smaller CSV files and then import each smaller file into its own sheet (*not recommended*).

---

## A sheet for an entity

Once imported into a spreadsheet, the data appears in a typical nicely-aligned *row/column structure*.

![Spreadsheet with rows and columns](../files/data_formats/spreadsheet_structure.png)

--

- Each *row* is a *record* with *fields* in the *columns* describing various attributes of *one particular instance of the entity*.

--

- In this example, each row represents *one day in one US county* during the pandemic.

---

## Simple statistics

Spreadsheets are great for simple statistical analysis, such as finding the *sum*, *average*, *minimum*, *maximum*, *standard deviation*, of a series of values.

--

- To do this, we will run formulas using the spreadsheet's *built-in functions*.

--

- To enter a formula into a cell, click into the cell and type the equals sign `=` followed by the formula.

--

-  To calculate total deaths, enter `=SUM( F1 : F914029 )` into column `F` of a new row at the very end of the spreadsheet, where `F1` is the first cell in the deaths column, and `F914029` is the last value in that column - your last row number will differ.  Hit the `enter/return` key when done.

## Passing the smell test
Always use your common sense to think about whether the raw data and your analysis of that data make sense... the so-called *smell test*.

--

- Summing the values in the deaths column leads to a result of about *50 million deaths from COVID-19 in the US* at the time of this writing.

--

- Authoritative reports put that number at about *400,000 deaths* at the time of this writing.

--

- Something does not smell good!  

--

- Either the raw data is flawed, or we are wrong in our analysis.

--

- What went wrong?!


---

template: example

## The meaning of the data
Upon further inspection, it seem that each row in the data set represents the *cumulative data for that county*.

--

- So we have misunderstood the meaning of the data - *a very very common problem*.

--

- Since each record includes a cumulative count of the deaths, in order to calculate total US deaths, we simply have to *sum the death counts for all counties on the most recent day available in the data set*: `=SUM( F910784 : 914028 )` (your row row numbers may differ if viewing more recent data)

--

- This results in a *total US death count of 372,651* (as of January 9th 2021)... a better-smelling number.

---

template: example

## Assumptions
In doing such a simple calculation, we have made a series of assumptions that we should be aware of, in case they prove to be false.

--

- We have assumed that the raw data is reliable and trustworthy

--

- We have assumed that no deaths are counted simultaneously in two or more different US counties 

--

- We have assumed that the data set includes one record for every US county on each day

--

- How can we check these assumptions?

# Imposing Criteria

--

## Analyzing a subset of records
What if we wanted to count only *total COVID-19 cases in New York's Hudson Valley region*, which is composed of 11 of New York State's 62 counties..

--

- Basic statistical functions, such as `SUM()`, `AVERAGE()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `STDEV()` work similarly to what we have seen.  But they cannot filter the records for us.

--

- Remember, the counts are cumulative. So let's copy just the records for the most recent date and *put them into their own sheet*.  This will speed up the program massively and can now be shared in a web-based spreadsheet - see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ddVWvL9O4uFPir5XGVP21n0_jhZItq--Fu7psPE4mrM/edit?usp=sharing).

--

- We could manually add up the case counts for the 11 counties of interest, but that would be very time consuming.

--

- Rather, we should use the *spreadsheet's filtering abilities* to extract data from the rows representing the counties of interest to us, and then run our statistics functions on just those filtered results.

---

## Filtering records
To calculate *total COVID-19 case counts in New York's Hudson Valley region*, we will go step-by-step, rather than try to do everything at once.

--

- First create two new columns: one for county names and the other for case counts.

![Extraction column](../files/data_formats/spreadsheet_extraction_column.png)

---

template: criteria

## Filtering records (continued)
Now add a formula into the `Case count` field corresponding to the first county: `=SUMIF( B:B, H2, E:E )`.  Note the use of `SUMIF` to add criteria.

--

- `SUMIF` will sum together case counts (column `E`) for any records where the county (column `B`) matches the county name of interest (cell `H2`).

--

- Copy this formula into the `Case counts` field for each county.  Be sure to update `H2` to be the correct cell identifier for each county.

--

- You can use the spreadsheet's *autofill* feature to do this copying for you.

--

![Extraction complete](../files/data_formats/spreadsheet_extraction_column_complete.png)

---

template: criteria

## Filtering records (continued again)
We now have total case counts for each county of interest.  If we add them all up, we will have *total case counts for the entire Hudson Valley*.

--

- In our custom `Case counts` column, in a row below the last county of interest, enter a function to calculate the `SUM` of all case counts.  A bit more than `600,000` as of January 9.

## Mashing up data sets
We know how many COVID-19 cases there have been in the Hudson Valley... but what percent of the population does this represent?

--

- Finding a reputable population estimate for each county is not difficult... ([for example](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html#par_textimage_739801612)).  `Cases as % of population` is only a simple formula away.

![Data mashup](../files/data_formats/spreadsheet_mashup.png)

---

template: criteria

## Results
Our data and initial analysis suggest that *more than 20% of the population in New York's Hudson Valley have had COVID-19*... that's 1 in every 5 people.

--

- Does this smell good?  Look over the numbers and do a sanity check.

--

- Where might we have gone wrong?

--

- What other assumptions might this result depend upon?
