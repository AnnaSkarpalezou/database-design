## Course description
Introduces principles and applications of databases. 

--

We survey a variety of common database systems, starting with *plain text data formats* and *spreadsheets*, and moving into *relational databases*, *document-oriented databases*, with a light touch of more advanced topics like *application programming interfaces (APIs)* and *blockchains* (i.e. cryptocurrencies)

--

Students explore principles of database design and apply those principles to computer systems in general and in their respective fields of interest.

## What is a database anyway?
A database is any system or tool used for storing data.

--

- usually stores *structured* data, although *unstructured* data sets certainly do exist

--

- usually makes it *fast* to find data you are looking for...

--

- ... especially data that meet *criteria* you indicate

--

- usually easily-integrated into computer programs

---

## Conventions
While there might be, in theory, many different kinds of database systems, in practice only a few kinds dominate in today's workplace.

--

We will explore a few representatives of the most popular kinds.

## Database systems
We will look in some detail at a few database systems:

--

- Text-based data formats (e.g. *CSV*, *JSON*, *XML*)

--

- Spreadsheets (e.g. Microsoft *Excel*, Google *Sheets*, Apple *Numbers*, OpenOffice *Calc*)

--

- *SQL*ite (an example of a *relational database*)

--

- *MongoDB* (an example of a document-oriented database)

--

- *Pandas* (a Python module for data analysis)

---

## Teasers into other topics
We will take **brief looks** at a few exciting topics that might lead you towards future directions that interest you:

--

- Connecting databases to *web apps*

--

- Application programming interfaces (*APIs*)

--

- *Data visualization*

--

- Blockchain, *bitcoin*, and other cryptocurrencies

---

## Skills we will develop
You cannot do contemporary work with data and databases without honing a few skills:

--

- *Python* programming

--

- *Jupyter Notebooks*

--

- *SQL* programming

--

- Version control (i.e. `git`)

---

template: topics

## Questions we will answer
There are common questions we will aim to answer:

--

- How do I set up my computer so I can work on data problems effectively?

--

- What are the most common problems that databases are designed to solve?

--

- How do you solve those problems?

--

- What are some of the considerations when choosing one database over another?

--

- How do I set up a database properly in a well-organized fashion?

--

- My internship requires me to know SQL.... what is that?

--

- My friend is making mad money at a start-up using MongoDB... can I learn that?
