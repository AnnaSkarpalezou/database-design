# Database Design

Slides used to teach a survey of the nuts and bolts of using databases.

## Publishing slides

Slides are auto-generated from the materials in the `docs` folder using Git Pages.
- view any slide deck online at https://nyu-computer-science.github.io/database-design/slide-name, where *slide-name* is replaced by the *permalink* indicated at the top of each slide markdown file in the `docs` folder.

## Running locally

- Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) globally
- `cd` into the `docs` directory
- run `jekyll serve`
- a `server address` will be displayed - visit this address in your web browser
